# Conway's Game of Life

## What is it?
Conway's **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway in 1970. Once an initial configuration is set, the game runs on its own, showing the evolution according to some set rules. The game is Turing complete.

## The rules:
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
                1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
                2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
                3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## What is Turing complete?
A system of data-manipulation rules, such as a cellular automaton, is Turing complete if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. In other words, the system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Most programming languages, such as C, Java, and Python are also Turing-complete.
