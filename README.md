# Conway's Game of Life

## What is it?
Conway's **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway in 1970. Once an initial configuration is set, the game runs on its own, showing the evolution according to some set rules. The game is Turing complete.

## What is Turing complete?
A system of data-manipulation rules, such as a cellular automaton, is Turing complete if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. In other words, the system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Most programming languages, such as C, Java, and Python are also Turing-complete.

optional features:


# Add additional cell properties, like color or size, and incorporate them into your visualization

# Allow users to specify the speed of the simulation

# Allow users to change the dimension of the grid being displayed
